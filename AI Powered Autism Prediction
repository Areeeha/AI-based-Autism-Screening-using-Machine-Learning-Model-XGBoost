# üß† AI-based Autism Screening using Machine Learning (XGBoost + SHAP)

This project presents a machine learning-based autism screening tool designed to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using publicly available datasets, the AQ-10 questionnaire, and an explainable AI (XAI) interface powered by SHAP.

## üìå Project Overview

Early and accurate screening of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is crucial for timely intervention. In this project, we built a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm to identify individuals at risk of autism based on both questionnaire responses and demographic/medical attributes.

The system also integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent and interpretable predictions to aid clinical understanding and trust.

## üìä Dataset and Preprocessing

We combined multiple ASD screening datasets and applied the following preprocessing steps:
- Removal of invalid and missing values
- Feature selection using **Entropy and Information Gain**
- Final selection of **15 key features**
- Normalization of numerical variables and encoding of categorical ones

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

Several ML models were trained and evaluated, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- **XGBoost (Best performing model)**

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| XGBoost            | 0.8969   | 0.7738    | 0.8553 |
| Random Forest      | 0.8935   | 0.7711    | 0.8421 |
| Logistic Regression| 0.8832   | 0.7625    | 0.8026 |

## üìà SHAP-Based Explainability

We used **SHAP** to provide model explainability, visualizing how different features contribute to the final prediction. The output `shap_result.html` includes:
- Force plot for individual prediction
- Global feature importance

This improves trust in the AI model by offering transparency to clinicians and users.

The system includes a simple FastAPI-powered web interface with:
- AQ-10 questionnaire form
- Prediction result screen
- SHAP graph viewer for explanation
